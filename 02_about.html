            <p id="description">
                Exploration and curiosity are driving my fascination for novelty and experimental technologies. Trained as an architect, I'm always trying to combine the best of
                both worlds. This synthesis turns out to be a very fruitful one and is serving as my creative engine.
                In the balancing act between imagination and reality, I strive for a convergence of innovative, social and sustainable ambitions.
                I am eager to contribute to a more holistic approach with the needed respect towards our environment.<br>
                <br>
                On my journey through ETH ZÃ¼rich, MVRDV Rotterdam, HSLU Luzern and other smaller adventures I collected quite a diverse set of skills, projects and experiences. 
                Ranging from storytelling with text, images, models and videos, to material tests with ice and concrete and to scripting buildings and coding websites, 
                I'm always enthusiastic about a new challenge.
